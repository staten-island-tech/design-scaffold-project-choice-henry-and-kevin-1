    text: "One of Sydneys most noticiable icons, it was built in 1932 and is the worlds largest steel arch bridge. Scaling the bridge is one of Australia's top outdoor adventures, and you can choose from a range of different tours. Sydney BridgeClimb takes groups on an approximately 3.5-hour climb to the top of the outer arch. Tours run throughout the day, beginning with a dawn climb and ending with a night climb. You can also choose from different types of climbs, including an Indigenous storytelling experience and a climb right across the arch to the other side â€“ the bridge connects the harbor's north and south shores.",
